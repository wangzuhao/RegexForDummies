He founded his 1st job in a company named as GOT, under boss Joffrey.\n \nJoffrey: Hello John Snow, welcome to join the GOT, a lot of the task will be performed using REGEX. Hope you would enjoy it.\n \nJohn: Hi Joffrey, I am sorry, but I know nothing about REGEX.\n \nJoffrey: No worries, it is normally, let me introduce Sam to you, who is very experienced in REGEX, if you have any question fee free to approach him.\n \nSam: hello John, let us start the Journey of REGEX, and it is so easy to handle! The first lesson is what is REGEX.\n \nThe introduction indicates the scope of the tutorial and which regex flavors are discussed. It also introduces basic terminology.\n \nRegular expressions, or regexes for short, are a way to match text with patterns. They are a powerful way to find and replace strings that take a defined format. For example, regular expressions can be used to parse dates, urls and email addresses, log files, configuration files, command line switches or programming scripts.\n \nSince regexes are language independent, we're trying to keep this tutorial as language independent as possible and only regex syntax related material will be introduced.Throughout the tutorial, you will learn and practice using regex from beginning level to advanced usage. Below is an video which give you overall picture of what regex is , how it works and what they are useful for.\n\nHere are a few practical examples of regular expressions.\n \nEmail matching: It's often necessary to check if a string is an email address or not.\n \nParsing dates: Date strings are difficult to parse because there are so many variations. If a match is found, you can be sure that the input string is formatted like a date.\n \nthe following lessons and examples will explore the more practical uses of regular expressions so that you can use them as quickly as possible."}
