He asked me to find out all documents containing the word â€˜correctâ€™, but when I try to match â€˜correctâ€™, the word â€˜incorrectâ€™ will be matched as well!\n\nSam: No worry, let me teach you a new regex metacharacter: \\b. This metacharacter will match an alpha-numerical word boundary, you can put it before and after a word to get exact match of a word. For example, in the string â€˜you are correct that the answer is incorrectâ€™, \\bcorrect\\b will only match the word â€˜correctâ€™.\n\nSnow: Great! But how about the word â€˜correctedâ€™, I think I need to keep this word as well.\n\nSam: You can put Question Mark behind a character to denote an optional character. You can just write correcte?d? To match both â€˜correctâ€™ and â€˜correctedâ€™. Of course, donâ€™t forget \\b if you donâ€™t want â€˜incorrectâ€™.\n\nSnow: Awesome! One last question: what if I want the target word to be always at the beginning of the text? Say, I want â€˜correct answer!â€™ instead of â€˜answer correct!â€™.\n\nSam: This time you can use Hat and Dollar Sign, also called anchor, to do so. If you put ^ in front of a word, only lines starting with the word will be returned. Similarly, if you put $ right after a word, only lines ending with the word will be returned.\n\nSnow: Thanks man! I need to go and get my tasks done! "}
